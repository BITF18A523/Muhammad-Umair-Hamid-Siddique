<h1>1.Git add</h1>
<img src="git add.png" alt="git add" width="700" height="20">
<p><b>What git add does</b></p>
<p>The git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area. It tells Git that you want to include updates to a particular file in the next commit. However, git add doesn't really affect the repository in any significant wayâ€”changes are not actually recorded until you run git commit</p>
<h2>2.Git commit</h2>
<img src="first commit.png" alt="git commit" width="700" height="20">
<p><b>What commit does</b></p>
<p>The git commit command is used to move files from the staging area to a commit. This command is run after git add, which is used to add files to the staging area. git commit creates a snapshot of the changes made to a Git repository which can then be pushed to the main repository when the developer is ready to do so</p>
<h3>3.Push command</h3>
<img src="git push.png" alt="git push" width="600" height="20">
<p><b>What push command does </b></p>
<p>The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo. It's the counterpart to git fetch , but whereas fetching imports commits to local branches, pushing exports commits to remote branches.</p>
<h4>4.Commit on github</h4>
<img src="commit on github.png" alt="commit" width="190" height="40">
<p><b>How commit looks on Github</b></p>
<p>Thats How your Commits look on github. Here We can see our first commit with the message "First Commit" as we typed in our commit command.If you click on "First Commit" in the red box. You can see the content uploaded to that commit.</p>
<p><b>5.File content</b></p>
<img src="file content.png" alt="commit" width="350" height="150">
<p><b>File contents on git hub</b></p>
<p>This content is uploaded from our local repository to the github.</p>
<p><b>6.Editing the file online</b></p>
<img src="edit file online.png" alt="commit" width="1200" height="350">
<p><b>Online editing your file</b></p>
<p>When You are in a branch you can edit a file on your online Repository by clicking on the edit button as shown in the Picture.
Branches are Explained below on this page.</p>
<p><b>7.Online commiting on git hub</b></p>
<img src="online commit.png" alt="commit" width="1200" height="350">
<p><b>Commititing changes online</b></p>
<p>When you commit on github it saves your repository state. Just like it does on your local Repository.</p>
<p><b>8. Git pull</b></p>
<img src="git pull.png" alt="commit" width="500" height="40">
<p><b>What Git pull does</b></p>
<p>Just like, when we commit a change in our local repository, we have to use push command to save changes onto our github repository,We use pull command when we make a change in our github reposirtory in order to bring committed changes to our local repositories. In our 
case the code was already up to date.</p>
<p><b>9.Online changes</b></p>
<img src="change made online.png" alt="commit" width="450" height="175">
<p><b>Pulling online changes from git hub</b></p>
<p>We pull the changes that were made online to the file. We pull these changes into our local repository by using git pull command</p>
<<<<<<< HEAD
 <p><b>10.Local change</b></p>
 <img src="local change.png" alt="commit" width="300" height="20">
 <p><b>Local made change</b></p>
 <p>This change to the code is locally made</p>
 <p><b>11.Merge conflict</b></p>
 <img src="Merge conflict.png" alt="commit" width="900" height="220">
 <p><b>Merge problem</b></p>
 <p>When you make a change in your local repository and someone makes a change on online there occurs a merge conflict.As Shown Above in the Picture.</p>

=======
	<p> This change was made online </p>

<p><b>12.Merge solution</b></p>
<img src="Merge sol.png" alt="commit" width="600" height="220">
<p><b>How Merge conflict is solved</b></p>
<p>IDE gave us a hint to use Git Pull Command to resolve the conflict.So here we used pull command.</p>
<p><b>13.Changes shown in IDE</b></p>
<img src="Changes shown.png" alt="commit" width="400" height="80">
<p><b>Online changes shown in IDE</b></p>
<p>The changes we made online show in our ide when we used git pull</p>
<p><b>14.Merge conflict solved</b></p>
<img src="Merge resolved.png" alt="commit" width="600" height="220">
<p><b>Merge problem solved</b></p>
<p>After Pulling changes from Online repository into our local, we made a new commit and pushed it as shown in the picture.</p>
<p><b>15.Branching</b></p>
<img src="branching.png" alt="commit" width="650" height="220">
<p><b>Use of branching and its example</b></p>
<p>Here's an example of how Git branches are useful. Let's say you need to work on a new feature for a website. You create a new branch and start working. You haven't finished your new feature, but you get a request to make a rush change that needs to go live on the site today. You switch back to the master branch, make the change, and push it live. Then you can switch back to your new feature branch and finish your work. When you're done, you merge the new feature branch into the master branch, and both the new feature and rush change are kept</p>
<p><b>16.Creating a branch</b></p>
<img src="new branch.png" alt="commit" width="650" height="40">
<p><b>Branch being created</b></p>
<p>A new branch is created using git checkout command.</p>
<p><b>17.Checking the head</b></p>
<img src="checking head.png" alt="commit" width="550" height="60">
<p><b>Head check</b></p>
<p>The branch we are heading is showning in green color with an asteric</p>
