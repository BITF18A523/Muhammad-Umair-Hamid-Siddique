<p><b>What git add does</b></p>
<p>The git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area. It tells Git that you want to include updates to a particular file in the next commit. However, git add doesn't really affect the repository in any significant wayâ€”changes are not actually recorded until you run git commit</p>
<h2>2.Git commit</h2>

<p><b>What commit does</b></p>
<p>The git commit command is used to move files from the staging area to a commit. This command is run after git add, which is used to add files to the staging area. git commit creates a snapshot of the changes made to a Git repository which can then be pushed to the main repository when the developer is ready to do so</p>
<h3>3.Push command</h3>

<p><b>What push command does </b></p>
<p>The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo. It's the counterpart to git fetch , but whereas fetching imports commits to local branches, pushing exports commits to remote branches.</p>
